# calculator

Fifth project from The Odin Project course. This project's goal was to build a calculator with basic operators, a simple calculator with a UI. This, only using html, css and javascript. Had fun building this one.

In this project I got to use my knowledge of javascript so far and I did learn the stuff better as I had to use it for my own. I learned how to chain different functions, conditions etc. I definitely feel like I know Javascript better after finishing this project.
